Below is the full README.md from the original SvelteKit version: [https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit)\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n- 🚀 **Astro v5** for lightning-fast static sites\n- ⚛️ **React v19** for interactive components\n- 🎨 **Tailwind v4** for utility-first styling\n- 📝 **MDX** for rich content authoring\n- 🔍 **Shiki** for beautiful syntax highlighting\n- 📱 **Responsive** design that works everywhere\n- 🌙 **Dark mode** with manual toggle\n- 📈 **Performance** optimized by default\n\n## Migration from SvelteKit\n\nThis version maintains complete feature parity with the original SvelteKit version while leveraging Astro's unique strengths:\n\n- Islands Architecture - Ship only the JavaScript you need\n- Local MDX files instead of GitHub Issues CMS\n- Modern tooling with TypeScript v5\n- Improved build performance and bundle size\n\n## Code Examples & Syntax Highlighting\n\nThis section demonstrates Shiki syntax highlighting across different languages:\n\n### TypeScript/JavaScript\n\n```typescript\ninterface BlogPost {\n  title: string;\n  slug: string;\n  date: Date;\n  category: 'Essay' | 'Note';\n  tags: string[];\n  featured?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const posts = await getCollection('blog');\n  return posts.map(post => ({\n    params: { slug: post.slug },\n    props: { post },\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n### React/JSX\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function DarkModeToggle() {\n  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const stored = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n    setIsDark(stored === 'dark');\n  }, []);\n\n  const toggleTheme = () => {\n    const newTheme = isDark ?

([details and code samples here](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/layout-breakouts-in-swyxkit))\n  - Top level blog URLs (`/myblog` instead of `/blog/myblog` - [why?](https://www.swyx.io/namespacing-sites/))\n  - Autogenerated (overridable) og:images via an external service https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit/pull/161\n  - Table of Contents for posts that have multiple headings, mobile friendly - done with [@vnphanquang's svelte-put/toc](https://svelte-put.vnphanquang.com/docs/toc)\n- General features\n  - Newsletter signup box - defaulted to [Buttondown.email](https://buttondown.email/) but easy to customize to whatever\n  - Navlink hover effect\n  - [Mobile/Responsive styling](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/mobileresponsive-styling-with-tailwind)\n      - Mobile menu with animation\n  - Og:image and meta tags for social unfurls (image generated via https://tailgraph.com/)\n  - Accessibility\n      - SVG Icons https://github.com/sw-yx/spark-joy/blob/master/README.md#general--misc\n      - [Tap targets](https://web.dev/tap-targets/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr)\n  - Custom scrollbar https://css-tricks.com/strut-your-stuff-with-a-custom-scrollbar/\n  - Defensive CSS touches https://ishadeed.com/article/defensive-css\n\n**Developer Experience**\n\n*Making this easier to maintain and focus on writing not coding.*\n\n  - [JSDoc Typechecking](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/how-to-add-jsdoc-typechecking-to-sveltekit)\n  - ESLint + Prettier\n  - [Nightly lockfile upgrades](https://mobile.twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1489287560387956736)\n  - Design system sandbox/\"Storybook\" setup with [Histoire](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/adding-a-histoire-storybook-to-swyxkit). `npm run story:dev` to view it on http://localhost:6006/. \n\nOverall, this is a partial implementation of https://www.swyx.io/the-surprisingly-high-table-stakes-of-modern-blogs/\n\n## Setup\n\n### Step 0: Clone project (and deploy)\n\n```bash\nnpx degit https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit\nexport GH_TOKEN=your_gh_token_here # Can be skipped if just trying out this repo casually\nnpm install\nnpm run start # Launches site locally at http://localhost:5173/ \n# you can also npm run dev to spin up histoire at http://localhost:6006/\n```\n\nYou should be able to deploy this project straight to Netlify as is, just [like this project is](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swyxkit/deploys/). This project [recently switched](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit/pull/100#issue-1352898457) to use `sveltejs/adapter-auto`, so you should also be able to deploy to Vercel and Cloudflare, but **these 2 deploy targets are not regularly tested** (please report/help fix issues if you find them)!\n\nHowever, to have new posts show up, you will need to personalize the `siteConfig` (see next step) - take note of `APPROVED_POSTERS_GH_USERNAME` in particular (this is an allowlist of people who can post to the blog by opening a GitHub issue, otherwise any rando can blog and that's not good).\n\n[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit)\n\n```bash\n# These are just untested, suggested commands, use your discretion to hook it up or deploy wherever\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"initial commit\"\ngh repo create # Make a new public GitHub repo and name it whatever\ngit push origin master\nntl init # Use the Netlify cli to deploy, assuming you already installed it and logged in. You can also use `ntl deploy`\n```\n\n### Step 1: Personalization Configuration\n\nAs you become ready to seriously adopt this, remember to configure `/lib/siteConfig.js` - just some hardcoded vars I want you to remember to configure.\n\n```js\nexport const SITE_URL = 'https://swyxkit.netlify.app';\nexport const APPROVED_POSTERS_GH_USERNAME = ['sw-yx']; // IMPORTANT: change this to at least your GitHub username, or add others if you want\nexport const GH_USER_REPO = 'sw-yx/swyxkit'; // Used for pulling GitHub issues and offering comments\nexport const REPO_URL = 'https://github.com/' + GH_USER_REPO;\nexport const SITE_TITLE = 'SwyxKit';\nexport const SITE_DESCRIPTION = \"swyx's default SvelteKit + Tailwind starter\";\nexport const DEFAULT_OG_IMAGE =\n\t'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/147861359-3ad9438f-41d1-47c8-aa05-95c7d18497f0.png';\nexport const MY_TWITTER_HANDLE = 'swyx';\nexport const MY_YOUTUBE = 'https://youtube.com/swyxTV';\nexport const POST_CATEGORIES = ['Blog']; // Other categories you can consider adding: Talks, Tutorials, Snippets, Podcasts, Notes...\nexport const GH_PUBLISHED_TAGS = ['Published']; // List of allowed issue labels, only the issues having at least one of these labels will show on the blog.\n```\n\nOf course, you should then go page by page (there aren't that many) and customize some of the other hardcoded items, for example:\n\n- Add [the Utterances GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) to your repo/account to let visitors comment nicely if logged in.\n- The `src/Newsletter.svelte` component needs to be wired up to a newsletter service (I like Buttondown and TinyLetter). Or you can remove it of course.\n- Page `Cache-Control` policy and SvelteKit `maxage`\n- Site favicons (use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to make all the variants and stick it in `/static`)\n- (If migrating content from previous blog) setup Netlify redirects at `/static/_redirects`\n\nThis blog uses GitHub as a CMS - if you are doing any serious development at all, you should give the `GH_TOKEN` env variable to raise rate limit from 60 to 5000.\n\n- A really basic personal access token should be enough and can be created [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).\n  https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting\n- For local dev: run `export GH_TOKEN=MY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_GITHUB` before you run `npm run start`\n- For cloud deployment: [Set the env variables in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables) (basically go to  https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE/settings/deploys#environment )\n\n### Step 2: Make your first post\n\nOpen a new GitHub issue on your new repo, write some title and markdown in the body, **add a `Published` tag** (or any one of the label set in `GH_PUBLISHED_TAGS`), and then save.\n\nYou should see it refetched in local dev or in the deployed site pretty quickly. You can configure SvelteKit to build each blog page up front, or on demand. Up to you to trade off speed and flexibility.\n\nHere's a full reference of the [YAML](https://eemeli.org/yaml-playground/) frontmatter that swyxkit recognizes - ALL of this is optional and some of have aliases you can discover in `/src/lib/content.js`. Feel free to customize/simplify of course.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: my great title\nsubtitle: my great subtitle\ndescription: my great description\nslug: my-title\ntags: [foo, bar, baz]\ncategory: blog\nimage: https://my_image_url.com/img-4.png\ndate: 2023-04-22\ncanonical: https://official-site.com/my-title\n---\n\nmy great intro\n\n## my subtitle\n\nlorem ipsum \n```\n\nIf your `Published` post (any post with one of the labels set in `GH_PUBLISHED_TAGS`) doesn't show up, you may have forgotten to set `APPROVED_POSTERS_GH_USERNAME` to your GitHub username in `siteConfig`.\n\nIf all of this is annoying feel free to rip out the GitHub Issues CMS wiring and do your own content pipeline, I'm not your boss. MDSveX is already set up in this repo if you prefer not having a disconnected content toolchain from your codebase (which is fine, I just like having it in a different place for a better editing experience). See also my blogpost on [the benefits of using GitHub Issues as CMS](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/moving-to-a-github-cms).\n\n## Optimizations to try after you are done deploying\n\n- Customize your JSON+LD for [FAQ pages](https://rodneylab.com/sveltekit-faq-page-seo/), [organization, or products](https://navillus.dev/blog/json-ld-in-sveltekit).
