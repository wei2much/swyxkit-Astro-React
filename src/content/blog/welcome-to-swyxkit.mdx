Welcome to the **Astro + React** version of SwyxKit! This is a complete port of the popular SvelteKit blog template, now powered by modern web technologies for even better performance and developer experience.

## What's New in the Astro Version

This port brings all the beloved features of the original SwyxKit while embracing modern web technologies:

### Core Technologies
- 🚀 **Astro v5** - Islands architecture for optimal performance
- ⚛️ **React v19** - Latest React with concurrent features
- 🎨 **Tailwind v4** - Next-generation CSS framework
- 📝 **MDX** - Rich content authoring with React components
- 🎨 **PrismJS** - Beautiful syntax highlighting with Shades of Purple theme
- 📱 **Responsive** design that works everywhere

### Key Improvements
- **Islands Architecture** - Ship only the JavaScript you need
- **Local MDX Files** - No more GitHub Issues CMS dependency
- **Better Performance** - Smaller bundle sizes and faster loading
- **Modern Tooling** - TypeScript v5, ESLint, Prettier
- **Enhanced DX** - Better development experience with Astro

## Code Example

Here's some beautiful syntax-highlighted code:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  date: Date;
  category: PostCategory;
  tags: string[];
  featured?: boolean;
}

export function createPost(data: BlogPost): BlogPost {
  return {
    ...data,
    date: new Date(data.date)
  };
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
4. Create your content:
   - **Blog posts**: Add `.mdx` files to `src/content/blog/`
   - **Pages**: Add `.mdx` files to `src/content/pages/`
5. Begin writing amazing content in MDX!

This template maintains complete feature parity with the original SvelteKit version while leveraging Astro's unique strengths for better performance and developer experience.

## Content Management

Unlike the original SwyxKit that used GitHub Issues as a CMS, this version uses local MDX files:

- **Blog posts** go in `src/content/blog/your-post.mdx`
- **Static pages** go in `src/content/pages/your-page.mdx`
- Full MDX support with React components
- Frontmatter for metadata and configuration

> **Note**: All original SwyxKit features have been preserved, including dark mode, search, RSS, and responsive design.

Happy blogging with Astro! 🎉
