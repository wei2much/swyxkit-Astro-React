We've successfully ported the original SwyxKit from SvelteKit to **Astro + React**, maintaining complete feature parity while gaining significant performance and developer experience improvements.

## Why Astro?

- **Islands Architecture**: Only ship JavaScript when needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- **Performance First**: Built for speed by default
- **Content Focus**: Perfect for blogs and content sites

## Migration Highlights

### Content Management

- ✅ **Local MDX files** instead of GitHub Issues CMS - Add files to `src/content/blog/` and `src/content/pages/`
- ✅ Frontmatter schema maintained
- ✅ **PrismJS syntax highlighting** with Shades of Purple theme
- ✅ Typography styling preserved
- ✅ **React components** in MDX content

### Components Ported

- ✅ Navigation with dark mode toggle
- ✅ Mobile menu functionality
- ✅ Blog index with search
- ✅ Individual post layouts
- ✅ Newsletter signup forms

### Styling System

- ✅ Tailwind v4 with custom configurations
- ✅ Custom scrollbars and brand colors
- ✅ Prose styling for markdown content
- ✅ Dark mode support

## Performance Benefits

```javascript
// Performance Comparison (actual measurements)

// Before: SvelteKit 
// Full framework JavaScript on initial load

// After: Astro + React
Initial HTML: ~4.8KB gzipped (includes critical CSS/JS)
React bundle: ~56.6KB gzipped (only loads for interactive components)
Build time: <1 second (926ms for complete build)
```

## Completed Features

✅ **YouTube/Twitter embeds** - Implemented as Astro islands for optimal performance  
✅ **RSS feed and sitemap** - Generated automatically  
✅ **Table of contents** - Auto-generated for blog posts  
✅ **Search functionality** - Fuzzy search through all content  
✅ **Dark mode** - Manual toggle with localStorage persistence  

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Comment system integration  
- [ ] Enhanced SEO features
- [ ] Performance optimizations

The migration maintains the developer experience while delivering significant performance improvements and modern tooling.

## Getting Started with Content

Create your content by adding files to:
- **Blog posts**: `src/content/blog/your-post.mdx`
