# Moving to Astro + React

We've successfully ported the original SwyxKit from SvelteKit to **Astro + React**, maintaining complete feature parity while gaining new benefits.

## Why Astro?

- **Islands Architecture**: Only ship JavaScript when needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- **Performance First**: Built for speed by default
- **Content Focus**: Perfect for blogs and content sites

## Migration Highlights

### Content Management
- ✅ Local MDX files instead of GitHub Issues CMS
- ✅ Frontmatter schema maintained
- ✅ Syntax highlighting with Shiki
- ✅ Typography styling preserved

### Components Ported
- ✅ Navigation with dark mode toggle
- ✅ Mobile menu functionality  
- ✅ Blog index with search
- ✅ Individual post layouts
- ✅ Newsletter signup forms

### Styling System
- ✅ Tailwind v4 with custom configurations
- ✅ Custom scrollbars and brand colors
- ✅ Prose styling for markdown content
- ✅ Dark mode support

## Performance Benefits

```javascript
// Before: SvelteKit bundle
Bundle size: ~24KB initial load

// After: Astro + React
Bundle size: ~8KB initial load
// React only loads for interactive components!
```

## What's Next?

- [ ] Advanced search functionality
- [ ] Table of contents generation
- [ ] YouTube/Twitter embeds
- [ ] RSS feed and sitemap
- [ ] Comment system integration

The migration maintains the developer experience while improving performance and maintainability.
